# Compressed NFTs  

Compressed NFTs are NFTs on Solana that store their data in a Merkle tree structure where the Merkle root is on-chain in an account and the Merkle leaves are stored in the Solana ledger (which is off-chain, but subject to consensus), rather than fully on-chain like conventional NFTs.
